Hurricane Analysis Project - Codecademy Data Science Path

This CodeAcademy project organizes and manipulates data about Category 5 Hurricanes.

Project write-up: 
Hurricanes, also known as cyclones or typhoons, are one of the most powerful forces of nature on Earth. Due to climate change caused by human activity, the number and intensity of hurricanes has risen, calling for better preparation by the many communities that are devastated by them. As a concerned environmentalist, you want to look at data about the most powerful hurricanes that have occurred.

It involved:
1. Cleaning up the damages list to convert the values (which included "B" and "M") into floats, as well as maintaining the "Damages not recorded" value. 
2. Constructing a dictionary made out of the lists, where the keys of the dictionary are the names of the hurricanes, and the values are dictionaries themselves containing a key for each piece of data (Name, Month, Year,Max Sustained Wind, Areas Affected, Damage, Death) about the hurricane.
3. Organizing the hurricanes in a dictionary with years - instead of names - as the key.
4. Writing a function that counts how often each area is listed as an affected area of a hurricane, and storing the area and its count as an affected hurricane area as a dictionary. 
5. Creating a function that finds the area affected by the most hurricanes, and how often it was hit.
6. Writing a function that finds the hurricane that caused the greatest number of deaths, and how many deaths it caused.
7. Rating hurricanes based on a mortality scale. 
8. Creating a function that finds the hurricane that caused the greatest damage, and how costly it was.
9. Rating hurricanes according to how much damage they cause using a damage scale.
